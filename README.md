# folder

file and folder helpers for use with Haxe when processing images, uses hxPixels and format.

( included NanoJpeg restructured as format.jpg.Reader but has some errors so if you try to load a jpg it will crash, and won't support progressive anyway have not informed NanoJpeg author of changes per license as code is not yet functional. )
